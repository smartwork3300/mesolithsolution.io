                            <p class="card-text">
                                Tony Sorensen, CEO of VersiqueSearch and Consulting and McKinley Consulting, one of the
                                leading
                                Minnesota IT and business consulting services group, says “recruiting is a competitive
                                industry, full of
                                people who love to celebrate the win, so one of the most important traits of a recruiter
                                is their
                                competitive drive”. Sorensen further adds, “It’s an attitude that reflects the desire to
                                help the client
                                hire top talent and the candidate land a great new position”.

                                The next important trait for being a successful recruiter is the ability to nurture
                                relationships and
                                maintain meaningful connections. Although some recruiters try to connect with as many
                                people as possible
                                on a superficial level, to create a vast network; it is actually the deep connections
                                that allow
                                successful recruiters to unify candidates and clients who suit each other. In this
                                connection, Sorensen
                                says that “Your reputation as a recruiter and your business will be much better off by
                                building genuine
                                relationships and maintaining them over time.”

                                Further, soft skills like confidence, goal-orientation, listening, relationship
                                building, communication,
                                time management and marketing the company and the role are also important traits of a
                                successful
                                recruiter, says Farhan Farooqui, President and CEO of HR Milieu, a Dallas, Texas-based
                                HR consulting
                                service provider. Farooqui further added that a successful recruiter must be a
                                team-player, having
                                phenomenal problem-solving skills and should be technology-driven.

                                Apart from these, Farooqui pointed out four crucial traits that are essential for the
                                success of any
                                recruiter.

                                Read the blog below to know about the important traits that every successful recruiter
                                must have.
                                <br>
                                1. Good understanding of the business and leading styles
                                <br>
                                Apart from having a good relationship with the hiring managers, a recruiter also needs
                                to have a good
                                understanding of the business and where the candidates shall fit. Not only this, a
                                recruiter needs to
                                have a good communication skill to be able to provide a realistic picture of the
                                position and the
                                leadership team or management with which the candidate needs to work while in job.
                                <br>
                                2. A strong technical aptitude and understanding
                                <br>
                                A recruiter needs to analyze the candidate from multiple angles. Those days are now a
                                long past when
                                Facebook and other uses of internet were considered a taboo in a workplace. Now-a-days a
                                recruiter not
                                just need to look at what the candidate tells about himself/herself on the resume, but
                                also at what is
                                not been said. Being technically savvy is crucial these days.

                                According to Farooqui, “Searching Google is a common practice for successful
                                recruiters”. Adding
                                further, “Being able to see the Tweets, Facebook posts, and LinkedIn presence of the
                                candidates is
                                becoming a necessity. Many times, what the resume says is quite different from what the
                                same candidate
                                said on LinkedIn or another social media site. Remember, not everyone has their tweets
                                protected”.
                                <br>
                                3. Having a futuristic approach
                                <br>
                                Farooqui says, to many recruiters, candidates are their next “fill”. Although filling a
                                job is
                                important, but on-the-job success of the candidates is crucial to any recruiting
                                process. Once
                                on-boarded the new recruits are forgotten by many recruiters. This is the key to
                                maintain relations with
                                the old recruits. Such individuals not only are a source of finding more talent to the
                                recruiter, but a
                                quick phone call to a new recruit after 90 days of working with the new company goes a
                                long way.

                                Farooqui further adds that, “We like to call a candidate after 90 days and ask a simple
                                question – ‘Is
                                this the position what I described to you during the interview process?’ If the answer
                                is no, there is
                                something to learn for the future hires”.

                                Finally, both Farooqui and HR Milieu put great stress on candidate’s/applicant’s
                                experience. Farooqui
                                believes in providing world class experience to all those who are interested to work in
                                any position. In
                                this connection, he says, “Hired or not hired, the recruiter should pay extreme
                                attention to each
                                applicant and feel that successful recruiting includes reputation management, which
                                originates from
                                candidate experience. It’s not what the new hire says – but what do the “non-selected”
                                candidates say
                                about your company, your professionalism, the process, and if asked, will they apply for
                                another
                                position at your company?”

                                Thus, recruiting is tough, but successful recruiters know to make it through.

                                Just like every other industry, the process of identifying and acquiring skilled workers

                                organizational needs has also witnessed a drastic change over time. All the innovations,

                                be left pondering whether they really know the organization at all or where do they

                                Similar to various other hiring strategies, the concept of Candidate Relationship
                                Management for CRM
                                also started in the consumer world. Knowingly or unknowingly everyone of us have been
                                the recipient of
                                numerous relationship marketing campaigns. The ongoing branded messages in the form of

                                methods are frequently used by the brands that we interact with. This is because the ROI
                                is very clear:
                                the consumers who engage with these channels are more likely to make repeated purchases,
                                give referrals

                                proposition. The relevancy and the core purpose behind these sorts of communications can
                                bring about
                                higher candidate engagement. It has been further observed that, candidates are more

                                certain things that
                                need to be kept in mind to ensure the successful deployment of CRM.
                                <br>
                                At the the very first instance it is important to consider how relationship marketing
                                shall align with
                                your organization’s overall strategy and how a CRM platform, in particular, can function
                                as a channel
                                for the organization’s broader initiatives. Think about the the team’s final goals. Is
                                it to increase
                                the headcount, or hit on a targeted diversity goal, or decrease the spending on media,
                                or support a new
                                business unit? Whatever may be the objective, the relationship marketing can function as
                                a strong
                                vehicle to drive results.
                                <br>
                                After identifying the goals, you can begin the process of drafting your communication
                                plan. First of
                                all, define your audience by deciding who you will be targeting and what kind of content
                                you want to
                                deliver. The next step is to review how you are connecting to the audience at present,
                                and then identify
                                where would relationship marketing fit in this workflow. Once identified, you can decide
                                on what your
                                messaging structure shall look like and the behavioral triggers that you might like to
                                utilize for any
                                multi-step drip campaign. Finally, invest time in analyzing your results. After a
                                campaign is deployed,
                                review your engagement as well as your internal processes and consider where
                                improvements are required
                                for your next send.

                                communication can be augmented by the use of collected candidate data points. A CRM
                                connected to a
                                candidate’s behavioral, contextual, and explicitly shared data can provide greater

                                experiences. As for example, say the physical location, time of visit, content viewed,
                                source, and other
                                on-site behavior of a candidate are captured and stored; this data can then be paired
                                with even more
                                data on candidates’ unique profile such as work experience, education, contact
                                information, and more.
                                This compiled data can then be made available to the CRM platform and can be leveraged
                                in infinite ways,
                                such as, delivering triggered email campaigns based on user’s interest and behavior
                                on-site. This data
                                can also be used to facilitate more targeted communication by a recruiter.

                            <p class="card-text">
                                According to a recent survey conducted by Talent Board, improving candidates’ experience
                                has been cited
                                by employers as their primary recruiting activity for the year 2021. The survey further
                                shows, 98% of
                                the employers believe that improving candidates’ experience can be helpful in enhancing
                                and protecting
                                their employer brand.
                                <br>
                                However, the biggest challenge being faced by employers is that in the past year, a
                                remarkable number of
                                employers had to shift from an in-person hiring process to a virtual one, to respond to
                                the covid-19
                                crisis, and this shift has not been an easy one.
                                <br>
                                Recent researches have shown that a positive virtual candidate experience makes the
                                candidates 38% more
                                likely to accept a job. This has made it very important for the companies to plan and
                                implement a
                                propitious virtual candidate journey, starting from outreach and initial screening to
                                interviewing and
                                onboarding.
                                <br>
                                Want to know about ways of providing a compelling virtual candidate experience? Here are
                                four
                                foundations that can help you!
                                <br>
                                Make communication your priority
                                One of the biggest mistakes committed by the employers is that they leave the candidates
                                to wait and
                                wonder. This is a grave mistake if you wish to provide a compelling virtual candidate
                                experience. In a
                                HR Technology survey, it was indicated that, 63% of candidates were dissatisfied with
                                the communication
                                from their employers. In addition to this, the survey showed that 1/3rd of job seekers
                                regard
                                ‘responsiveness’ as the most essential attribute, when it comes to candidate experience.
                                <br>
                                A prompt, clear and consistent communication is what exactly a candidate expects from a
                                hiring team
                                while interacting virtually and this is what makes all the difference. Further, reaching
                                out to the
                                candidates at every stage of recruitment develops a strong initial connection between
                                the candidate and
                                the employer. In addition to this, the employers that are seen to provide guidance and
                                resources such
                                as, tips for online interviewing, FAQ guides, and pre-interview technology check list
                                are seen to make a
                                more positive impression among the candidates.
                                <br>
                                Use the right technology to speed up the recruitment process
                                A survey conducted by Yello, a talent acquisition platform, revealed that more than half
                                of the
                                employers report their time-to-hire as three weeks or more. But, 81% of the candidates
                                hold that they
                                expect a two-week process. If you to find a similar disparity is lurking in your
                                recruitment process, it
                                is high time to switch to advanced technologies such as, Artificial Intelligence (AI),
                                automation, and
                                enhanced analytics to streamline the virtual candidate experience and shorten their
                                time-to-hire.
                                <br>
                                In addition, it has been seen that companies where the job application process takes
                                longer than five
                                minutes to complete, have experienced a high drop of rate, as high as 75%. Therefore,
                                these advanced
                                technologies can also be used in the initial application stage to ensure that the
                                application process is
                                fast and easy to complete. This shall increase the number of submissions and develop a
                                far better first
                                impression of the employer in the minds of the candidates. Further, 85-95% of the
                                candidates use their
                                mobile phones during the application process. Therefore, it is essential for the
                                employees to look for
                                tools that support a seamless search application process optimized for mobile phones.
                                <br>
                                Use survey tools to make hiring a two-way process
                                It has generally been seen that employers conduct surveys to gather feedback from their
                                candidates and
                                hiring managers at the key stages of the recruitment process, to create a better virtual
                                candidate
                                hiring experience. However, HR Tech tools can be a better option for it can automate
                                sending candidate
                                experience surveys, such as:
                                <br>
                                Survey on Job application process: This kind of survey can include a short questionnaire
                                to collect the
                                inputs from the candidates on their experience of using the application platform. This
                                would help in
                                gathering information on how accurately the positions and responsibilities were
                                described.
                                Post-interview Survey: This survey basically provides an opportunity to ask both the
                                candidates and the
                                recruiting team about any necessary changes that needs to be incorporated to improve and
                                enhance the
                                recruiting process.
                                <br>
                                Survey on offer rejection/candidate withdrawal: This kind of survey shall basically
                                focus on asking
                                questions to the candidates on their likelihood of applying in future. Further, in case
                                where any
                                candidate rejects the job offer, this survey would help the employers gather a feedback
                                about the
                                candidate’s overall experience and employer brand.
                                <br>
                                Make proper use of social media and employer sites to create accurate expectations
                                Employer branding plays a very important role in the recruitment process. But it plays
                                an even more
                                important role in a virtual experience, since it is the default format that the
                                candidates use to
                                interact with the company. In the survey conducted by HR Technologist, it was indicated
                                that more than
                                half of the candidates were willing to share their experiences through social media.
                                Further, 69% of the
                                candidates were found to have posted about their negative social media experience. It
                                has also been
                                found that negative reviews prevent candidates from applying for a position. Therefore,
                                it is very
                                important for the employers to leverage their digital and social media channels in order
                                to facilitate
                                candidate experience and at the same time boost their employer branding.

                                Be Positive
                                <br>

                                career opportunity. Most people these days are seen to have a very negative outlook
                                towards securing a
                                job. They are already seen to have made up their minds that they won’t be able to secure
                                a job due to
                                Covid-19. Therefore, instead of quitting before starting even starting your job
                                endeavor, what is
                                suggested is to be more positive, determined and to try understand the new trends in the
                                market to pitch
                                oneself in the right manner at the right time.
                                <br>
                                Be Bold
                                <br>
                                The next very important tip for advancing your career in post-Covid era is “be bold’.
                                You need to be
                                bold enough to step into new territories. Search for industries having highest number of
                                vacancies. Even
                                if you are new to the industry do not hesitate to give it a try. As for example, the
                                Health Care,
                                Logistics, IT, and the infrastructure and professional industry these days are seen to
                                offer tremendous
                                job opportunities. Therefore, be bold enough to step out of your comfort zone and
                                consider job
                                opportunities from different industries.
                                <br>
                                Make Proper Use of Social Media
                                <br>
                                Anything on your social media profile that goes against your professional reputation or
                                anything that
                                can cause havoc to it, needs to be removed immediately. Make proper and positive use of
                                your social
                                media profile. Keep updating your LinkedIn profile. Follow industries and organizations
                                you are
                                interested in. Use proper skills and keywords. Post on LinkedIn from time-to-time. This
                                will reveal your
                                interest in the market and help aid your application.
                                <br>
                                Show Your Flexibility
                                <br>
                                Owing to the large number of changes that are taking place both in the organization(s)
                                and in the wider
                                professional world, flexibility or adaptability has become one of the top-rated skills
                                that almost every
                                organization wants to have in its employees. It is therefore suggested to demonstrate
                                your flexibility
                                both in your resume as well as your interview.
                                <br>
                                Develop Connections
                                <br>
                                This is only possible when you are energetic and proactive in your job endeavor. Instead
                                of merely
                                sending your resume and sitting at home hoping for the best to happen (the traditional
                                approach), engage
                                yourself in reaching out to the concerned employer (through social media). Following up
                                the concerned
                                hiring manager would ensure that you are at the top of their mind. In fact, developing
                                connections has
                                become more important than ever before to make your way and shine. Therefore, it is
                                suggested to make
                                concerted efforts to draw the attention of the employer towards yourself.
                                <br>
                                Sell Yourself
                                <br>
                                Not everyone knows the art of selling oneself. Neither does this ability come naturally.
                                But the era we
                                are living in demands the art of selling oneself. In order to sell yourself, the very
                                first requirement
                                is to know ‘what are your selling points?’ Try to find out and understand your unique
                                strengths and how
                                your strengths can help strengthen the job you are applying/interviewing for. Once you
                                are sure about
                                your strengths, portray them. Do not forget to share concrete proofs of all your
                                achievements for each
                                of your selling points.
                                <br>
                                Further, always remember that the first impression you can make in an organization, is
                                in the interview.
                                So don’t miss dressing up professionally while going for an interview. This will help
                                you sell yourself
                                in a better way.

                                A satisfactory job is not so easy to find. In the era of increasing competition, getting
                                ‘the dream job’
                                has become very difficult. While applying for jobs, one might wonder, how one finds a
                                right job? What
                                makes the hiring mangers hire one over others?
                                <br>
                                Well, one probable answer to these questions is the ‘social profile of the candidate’. A
                                good social
                                profile is something that is very necessary for any candidate seeking job. In this
                                digital era, social
                                media profiles have become an important instrument for accessing the personality of an
                                individual
                                preliminarily, as well as to find out one’s overall experience and expertise. Hence, it
                                is essential for
                                the candidates seeking job to have a top-ranking social profile. Here, are a few tips
                                for the job
                                seekers to create a high-ranking social profile.
                                <br>
                                1. Profile picture matters
                                <br>
                                Undoubtedly, a picture, though small, is very important. The very first thing that a
                                placement
                                consultant would look at, while searching for candidates, is the ‘physical appearance’.
                                It is therefore,
                                suggestive to avoid pictures that make one look younger, or have some quirky background
                                in it. A clear,
                                recent picture in professional attire, shot in a clean background is the best thing that
                                can be added to
                                one’s social profile.
                                <br>
                                2. Background picture speaks a lot
                                <br>
                                The next thing that attracts the hiring managers is the ‘background picture’. It is
                                therefore suggestive
                                to select a background picture that either provides an insight about one’s current work
                                profile, or
                                skills and expertise, or one’s interests. Apart from this, small, crisp and interesting
                                quotes
                                reflecting one’s personality can act as an icing on the cake.
                                <br>
                                3. Let them know, you are open to new opportunities
                                <br>
                                Attention! Here, it is important to remember that, one is looking for ‘a new job
                                opportunity’, and
                                hence, mentioning the same in the profile is very important. Here, the job seeker can
                                include the
                                profile and location he/she is interested in. This would make it easy for the manager to
                                understand the
                                interest of the candidate.
                                <br>
                                4. Locate yourself
                                <br>
                                ‘Location’ is the next important element that needs to be mentioned in the profile. This
                                is because
                                organisations, at times, look for candidates from specific locations. Here, it is also
                                suggestive to
                                candidates to mention clearly, whether or not they are open to location change. This
                                small bit of
                                information can be effective in saving the time and energy of both, managers as well as
                                candidate.
                                <br>
                                5. Speak about your own self
                                <br>
                                Remember! It is candidate’s own profile. Therefore, he/she needs to ‘speak up about
                                his/her own self’.
                                In very brief and crisp words, the candidate needs to write what he/she does, what is
                                his/her work
                                interest, what he/she wants to do in future, his/her achievements, his/her contribution
                                professionally.
                                However, while doing so, the candidate must limit oneself and not exceed.
                                <br>
                                6. Acquaint them with your right skills
                                <br>
                                Last but not the least, comes ‘skills’. The best suggested way of adding skills to the
                                profile is
                                finding out the most searched keywords in the candidate’s respective field, and giving
                                them a position
                                in his/her own social profile. This will help the candidate secure top position in the
                                candidate’s list.
                                Here, the candidates can mention about the projects he/she has worked on, his/ her
                                expertise, his/her
                                creations (if any), about the benefits bought to an organisation by him/her, and such
                                others. Here, it
                                is again recommended to remain simple, crisp, clear, limited and to the point, so that
                                anyone could
                                easily understand the candidate and his/her work(s).

                                <br>
                                A company’s commitment to innovation is an important factor that requires consideration.
                                Innovation
                                refers to the ability to create or develop a new product. In case you work in business
                                strategy or R&D,
                                innovation shall be your obvious attraction. However, innovation should be a core
                                concern for every
                                applicant irrespective of their field of work.
                                <br>
                                You might be wondering why is it necessary for YOU to take into consideration the
                                ‘innovation’ factor of
                                the employer. Here’s why innovation is important.
                                <br>
                                Innovation Is What Predicts the Future of a Company
                                <br>
                                In the present times, technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of
                                Things (IoT)
                                have been accelerating the rate of change and disruption in almost all the industries.
                                Even the
                                strongest company of today may find itself in a weak position tomorrow, if it fails to
                                champion
                                innovation; and this in turn will have an impact on all the employees of the company.
                                <br>
                                The Benefits of Innovation Scatters Everywhere
                                <br>
                                Although you might not have a direct role to play in the innovation efforts of the
                                company, yet it can
                                be useful to you. Innovation can bring variety and interest to your work. As per
                                example, if you are in
                                a finance team, innovation can give you and your team a fresh challenge to forecast the
                                revenues for the
                                new product line. Therefore, the benefits of innovation are not restricted only to those
                                directly
                                involved with it, rather its benefits reach every person in the company.
                                <br>
                                Innovation is Not Merely the Creation or Development of New Product(S)
                                <br>
                                Every successful company acknowledges that innovation is not only about developing new
                                product(s) or
                                giving a new face to the product(s). They understand well that innovation is much beyond
                                development
                                teams and customers facing products and services. Innovation is rather an agent for
                                improvement of the
                                entire organization. It is an opportunity to change things for the better, which matters
                                to every job,
                                whether it is a development team, or marketing services, customer services or a HR.
                                <br>
                                Provides An Opportunity to Build Your Resume
                                <br>
                                To crack an interview being able to tell an alluring story about your experiences is
                                something very
                                critical. Stories about innovation play a very effective role in captivating the
                                interviewers. It
                                becomes easier to talk about the differences that you have personally created and the
                                impact that you
                                have brought into a business; when you are directly involved with an innovation,
                                compared to being a
                                simple spectator of what someone else has created.
                                <br>
                                A Strong Culture Can Only Be the Foundation of a Good Innovation
                                <br>
                                Generally, the cultural attributes such as, honesty, transparency, ambition,
                                purposefulness, collegiate
                                organizations, and the like; which are essential for building an environment for
                                innovation are the same
                                attributes that make an ideal workplace.
                                <br>
                                Commitment
                                <br>
                                Now that if you believe that innovation is an essential attribute that needs to be
                                considered before
                                applying for job in any company, it is essential for you to find out which company is in
                                the truest
                                sense committed to innovation. In the era when every company claims its commitment to
                                innovation, it is
                                essential to understand that the real proof of innovation lies on what a company does,
                                rather than on
                                what it says.
                                <br>
                                Here are a few signs of true commitment to innovation.
                                <br>
                                The Processes Are Crystalline
                                <br>
                                Keeping aside the romantic notion of innovation as a amalgamation of art and chaos, in
                                business settings
                                the processes supporting innovation are inevitable. Therefore, it is advisable to look
                                for clear picture
                                of how the ideas are prioritized, collected, tested and rolled out.
                                <br>
                                There Are No Ivory Towers
                                <br>
                                Although some companies may have certain roles dedicated to innovation as a result of
                                which the
                                innovation work can sometimes be physically or culturally separated from the rest of the
                                organization.
                                In spite of this, in an organization it should be everyone’s business to contribute his/
                                her own path to
                                innovation.
                                <br>
                                Healthy Attitude Towards Failure
                                <br>
                                The attitude towards failure is another important sign. “Fail fast, fail often” is the
                                mantra prevalent
                                in the enterprises, but in reality, failure can be unhealthy in case the team pulls them
                                off from taking
                                risks, or loose enthusiasm to succeed, after facing failure. The most appropriate
                                attitude towards
                                failure is somewhere between the two extremes, that is, looking for some success, but at
                                the same time,
                                accepting the failure and taking it as a lesson and working on it to improve oneself.
